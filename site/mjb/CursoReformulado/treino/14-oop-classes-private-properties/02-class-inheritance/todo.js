/**
 * 
 * Create a class Shape with name
 * Create a method logName to console log Shape Name: name
 * Now create a class Rectangle that inherite the Shape class
 * The class Rectangle must have name, width and height 
 * Note: super calls the parent class so as name have in parent we can call super(name) to inherit the 
 * attribute from parent
 * Create a class Circle that inherit the Shape class it must have name and radius
 * create another logName method in the Circle class logging Circle Name: name as an example of polymorphism
