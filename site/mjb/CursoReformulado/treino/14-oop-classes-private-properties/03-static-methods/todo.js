/**
 * We can create a static method so that we can call by the class instead of instantiate a new object
 * Create a class Rectangle with name,height and width
 * then create a method area and return height * width
 * then create a static method getClass that simply return 'Rectangle'
 * Now create a new object rect Rectangle 'Rect', 10, 10
 * console log rect area
 * and now to see that you don't need to stantiate a new object to call a static method
 * console log Rectangle.getClass();
