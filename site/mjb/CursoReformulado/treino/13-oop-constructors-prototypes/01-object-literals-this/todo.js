/**
 * 
 * JavaScript Object Literal is a data type used to define objects in JavaScript. It is a syntax for creating an 
 * object in JavaScript that is composed of key-value pairs. It is a lightweight and efficient way to create and 
 * store data. It is a great way to store related data in an organized manner.
 * 
 * Create a object object literal rectangle with name Rectangle 1 width 20 an height 10 also create a area method to return
 * the area width * height
 * 
 * Note: Do not know why the this key word does not work with arrow function, so use the word function to create methods
 * 
 * At the end console log rectangle area of both objects
 * 
 * To create another rectangle without oop we need to create another object literal 
 * so create a rectangle2 with same attributes and method but name Rectangle 2 * width 20 and height 20
 * With oop we could simple call const rectangle2 = new Rectangle
