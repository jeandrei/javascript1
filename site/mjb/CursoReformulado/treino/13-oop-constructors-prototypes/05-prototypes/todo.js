/**
 * Create a function object Rectangle with name, width and heigth 
 * Set this name, width and heigth
 * create a function area to return the width * height
 * 
 * Dealing with object prototypes 
 * Prototypes is a special object where additional methods and propertys can be 
 * attached and be shared across all instances of its constructor function
 * As default when we instanciate an object the constructor is gonna be under the prototype
 * Since prototype is an object it also have a prototype it is called the prototype chain
 * Its gonna be like an endles (Constructor/Prototype/Constructor/Prototype/Constructor/Prototype/Constructor)
 * The seq javascript looks for an method/property is first looks in the object itself, 
 * then looks in Prototype constructor, then it looks in the Prototype Object 
 * to see the prototypes in the console simple declare a variable and click in prototype
 *
