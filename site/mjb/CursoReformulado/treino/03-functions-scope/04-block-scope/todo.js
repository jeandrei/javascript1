// declare a const x with 100

// An If statement is a block you can access a global variable in an if statemant
// check if true console log x  const y = 200 and console log x + y

// try to console log y you'll see that y is not defined because of y is declared inside if statemant
// console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined

// A loop is a block
// create a for from 0 to 10 and console log the index

// if you try to console log the index outside the for bloc you'll get an error is not defined because i is in the scope of the for loop

// Using var, with var you can access outside the bloc scope, but it is not a good practice because it can cause a mess in your code
// if true declare a const a with 500 a let b with 600 and a var c with 700

// try to console log b and c

// var IS function scoped in function var became a function scope
// declare a function run with a var with 100 and console log d inside run function

// call run function

//try to console log d outside the function run you get an error because inside function var became function scope
