/**
 * 1 Create a function called `getCelsius()` that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as an argument and 
 * returns the temperature in celsius. formula ((f - 32) * 5) / 9 
 * expected result 32 shuld return 0 make it so that return a rounded number
 * For bonus points, write it as a one line arrow function
 * You can make the output look prettier by putting it into a string. You can even add `\xB0` (degrees) 
 * and a `C` in front of the celsius temperature.
 * The formula for Fahrenheit to Celsius is `(F - 32) * 5 / 9`. Read more about 
 * the formula [here](https://www.cuemath.com/fahrenheit-to-celsius-formula/) if needed.
 * 2 Create an arrow function called `minMax()` that takes in an array of 
 * numbers and returns an object with the minimum and maximum numbers in the array.
 * 3 Create an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that takes in the length and 
 * width of a rectangle outputs it to the console in a message as soon as the page loads.
 * The area of a rectangle is `length * width`. These should get passed into the IIFE as arguments.
