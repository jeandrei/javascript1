// If Statement Syntax
// Check if true and console log This is true

// Check if false end console log This is NOT true

// Evaluation expressions
const x = 10
const y = 5

// Check if x is greater or iqual to y and console log value x is greater than or equal to value y

// Check if x is iqual to y and console log x is iqual to y else console log x is NOT iqual to y

// Block scope const and let are block level scope if you change let to var you can access x out of if block
// Check if x is different to y if so create a const z = 20 and console log z is 20

// try to console log z out of the scope you'll get an error

// Shorthand If/Else
// When inside if we have just one line of code you don't need the {}
/*Check if x is greater or iqual to y if so console log x is greater or equal to y else console log this is false don't use {}*/
