// Setting object properties with the same name as a variable
const firstName = 'John'
const lastName = 'Doe'
const age = 30

// We don't need to do the firstName:firstName as both names are iqual
// create a object person with firstName, lastName and age

// console log person age

// Destructuring object properties

const todo = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'Take out trash',
  user: {
    name: 'John',
  },
}

// create a const that will get the values of todo but rename id to todoId and also gets the values of title and user name

console.log(todoId)

// Destructuring arrays & using the rest/spread operator
const numbers = [23, 67, 33, 49, 52]

// turn the number array into first, second and the rest

//console.log first, second and rest
